                Times Square is named after the New York Times. It was originally called Longacre Square until the Times moved there in 1904.

            <p>The city’s actual name has an interesting story behind it and one of its nicknames does too. 
                A ‘Big Apple’ referred to prizes awarded at horse racing events in the 1920s. 
                Since the term meant “the ultimate” prize or “the best”, many musicians and journalists started referring to New York with this name.</p>
